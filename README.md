# VectorCraft
VectorCraft is a library developed for performing algebraic operations on 3D vectors using C# and the .NET framework.

## Features
The aim of this project is to develop a library for the algebra of 3D vectors. The task consists of three parts:

1. **Class Library**: Implement a class library for the algebraic operations of 3D vectors.
2. **Unit Test Project**: Develop unit tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the class library.
3. **WPF Desktop Application**: Create an application that utilizes the class library to compute the cross product of two 3D vectors.

All three components are combined into a single Visual Studio project (solution).

## Specifications
Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK installed.
Install Visual Studio 2022 or later.

## Build and Run:
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B).
3. Run the WPF application (F5).
4. Compute the cross product of two 3D vectors.

## Unit Tests
VectorCraft library includes unit tests written using MSTest. To run the tests:

1. Open the Test Explorer (Test > Windows > Test Explorer).
2. Click “Run All” to execute the tests.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio to start development.
git clone https://github.com/Pedronet5/VectorCraft.git
